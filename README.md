# Room-design-react-website 

This website was developed with the intention of helping my father with his own business. I've used some trend javaScript-based tecnologies, such as node.js and reactjs. Further, IÂ´ve been studying javascript lately and this project helped me to enhance my knowledge using component states and some nodejs products to send e-mail templates. 

The project basic setups were made by running the `npm create-react-app`, which basically sets all the resources required to use JSX and react sintax. Also, I've focused on the user experience, so I developed a friendly and different form, providing a interative quiz with color picker and Tag buttons.
